- Sensiron SCD41

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vkypatna/sdc41_i2c.git
cd sdc41_i2c
```

Next, compile the driver according to your platform's requirements. Refer to the documentation for specific instructions.

## Usage

After installation, include the driver in your project. Here’s a basic example of how to initialize the sensor and read data:

```c
#include "sdc41_i2c.h"

void setup() {
    // Initialize I2C
    i2c_init();
    
    // Initialize the SCD41 sensor
    SCD41_Init();
}

void loop() {
    // Read CO2, temperature, and humidity
    float co2, temperature, humidity;
    SCD41_Read(&co2, &temperature, &humidity);
    
    // Output the values
    printf("CO2: %.2f ppm, Temperature: %.2f °C, Humidity: %.2f %%\n", co2, temperature, humidity);
    
    delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second
}
```
